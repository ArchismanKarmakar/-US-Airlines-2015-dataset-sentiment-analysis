### The US Airlines dataset (2015) contains 14,640 tweets (14,427 unique) collected between February 16-24, 2015, and covers 6 airlines with 15 data columns. We aim to explore the following research questions:

ðŸŸ  What is the relationship between airline sentiments and airlines? <br>
ðŸŸ  What is the reason for the negativity mentioned in the dataset? <br>
ðŸŸ  What is the relation of time with sentiments? <br>
ðŸŸ  Which model is best for sentiment analysis when we do ensemble learning?
